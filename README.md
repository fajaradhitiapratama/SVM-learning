# SVM Kernel Comparison with Different Preprocessing Techniques

This repository contains Python code to compare the performance of SVM kernels (linear, RBF, polynomial) on a dataset with different preprocessing techniques (Normalizer, MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler, RobustScaler) and different test sizes (0.3 and 0.2).

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
